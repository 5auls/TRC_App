# Triangle Reconstruction Customer Portal – Project Skeleton

This repository contains a baseline implementation of the Triangle Reconstruction customer portal.  It is composed of three major parts:

* **backend** – a FastAPI application that implements stub versions of the API contract for the customer portal.  It defines data models, routes and placeholder responses.  The backend is designed to be extended with integrations to Jobber, Stripe and SensorPush once credentials are available.
* **mobile** – a React Native skeleton using Expo that provides the structure for the customer‑facing mobile app.  It sets up bottom‑tab navigation and includes basic implementations for each primary section (Home, Jobs, Requests, Invoices, Messages and Account) using Zustand for state management and the company’s color palette.
* **admin** – a simple React app skeleton (with React Router) for the staff‑facing admin console.  It includes pages for dashboards, viewing service requests, managing memberships, publishing promotions and responding to chat threads.  A bundler such as Vite or Create React App is required to run this part.

The **docs** directory will hold design artefacts, wireframes, runbooks and other documentation.

## Running the backend

1. Ensure you have Python 3.11+ installed.
2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
```

3. Start the development server:

```bash
uvicorn backend.main:app --reload --port 8000
```

The API will be served at `http://localhost:8000`.  You can explore the autogenerated OpenAPI/Swagger docs at `http://localhost:8000/docs`.

## Mobile app skeleton

The mobile folder contains an Expo‑based React Native project skeleton.  It uses React Navigation for tab navigation and provides placeholder components for each screen.  To set up the project:

```bash
cd mobile
npm install
expo start
```

After starting the Expo development server the app will be ready to run on an iOS simulator, Android emulator or physical device.  **Firebase configuration:** the mobile app expects your Firebase configuration files in the `mobile` directory.  The iOS configuration file (`GoogleService-Info.plist`) is already included in `mobile/`.  When you obtain the Android configuration file (`google-services.json`), place it next to the plist.  These files are not committed to version control and must come from your own Firebase project.

## Admin console skeleton

The `admin` folder contains a basic React application.  To work with this code you will need to set up a bundler.  One simple approach is to use Vite:

```bash
cd admin
npm install
npx vite
```

The console will be available at `http://localhost:5173` by default.  Note that the skeleton uses the stub API at `http://localhost:8000` and does not include build tooling; adapt as needed for your environment.

## Next steps

* Fill in the backend with real data models and integrate with external services.
* Implement authentication and state management in the mobile app.
* Replace stub components with full UI implementations based on the supplied designs and color palette.
* Add unit and integration tests.
* Create operational runbooks and deployment scripts.
